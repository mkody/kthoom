    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      kthoom is an open source project.  There is no legal entity (company)
      associated with this project, only developers who donate their time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project does not collect any information about anything you read
      with kthoom.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project does not use browser cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
      kthoom consists solely of client-side code (a HTML page, its stylesheet,
      and associated JavaScript files).  kthoom does not talk to a server except
      as described below:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        If you want to read comic books from
        <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>, this project
        will require you to sign into Google and kthoom will let you choose a
        file from your Google Drive.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you want to read comic books from <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>,
        kthoom will connect to IPFS nodes to download the book file.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Client-only Mode</h2>
    <p>
      If you are uncomfortable with kthoom accessing servers over the network,
      it is totally within your rights to clone the
      <a href="https://github.com/mkody/kthoom/">github repository</a>,
      and then run a local web server to host your own copy to read comic books
      on your local hard drive.
